For this project I was instructed to make a quiz game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The requirements for the quiz game is it must include the following:

1.) Quiz must be timed
2.) when a wrong answer is selected the time must be subtracted from the timer. 
3.) When right answer is selected then you move on to the next question. 
5.) When all questions are answered or time runs out the game is over. 
6.) lastly initials and score should be saveable.

References I used for this video besides what was taught in class is YouTube. I found YouTube to be a huge influence in this project. I learned how to use arrows for functions in JavaScript. 

Another lesson I learned while building this project is how to make "container cards" appear and re-appear using DISPLAY: none and calling on the in the JS file using the "display.style=()" function in JS.
